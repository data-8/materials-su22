    "Welcome to Lab 7!\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, we will learn about [the variability of sample means](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/5/Variability_of_the_Sample_Mean.html) as well as [the normal distribution](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/3/SD_and_the_Normal_Curve.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Grading**: Here are the policies for getting full credit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can either attend your assigned lab section, make progress substantial enough for your work to be checked off, and submit your lab (even if it is incomplete) by the end of the lab period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OR complete the lab on your own, submit the completed lab by **Wednesday 7/20 at 11am** on the due date, and pass all autograder tests (100% of tests passed) to receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission**: Once you're finished, scroll up to the top of the page, and run every cell in the notebook.  Select \"Save\" in the File menu (please don’t hit Save As), then rerun the last cell of the notebook.  The result will contain a zip file that you can submit to Gradescope. If you are in lab, you can submit a ticket on lab.data8.org to ask a staff member to check you off. \n",
